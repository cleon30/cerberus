## **Introduction**

Cerberus is an on-chain solution to improve web3 IRL experience

## **Value Proposition**

IRL Blockchain events have an important role in the crypto space, and right now they are in a very early stage, usually lacking of on-chain tangible experience. 

In the upcoming years, mobile web3 phones will probably be our straight path to that experience. Because of that, we must start building for them.
 
## Purpose

Cerberus has been designed to improve the user experience on events, being a perfect way to bring web3 in a more tangible way.

Also, this project is aiming to normalize the use of crypto in the society, being a good way to feel crypto more tangible than ever.

# Project Description

## Project Description (I)

At the entrance of the event there will be an IP Camera transmitting video to our local computer through WiFi.

These frames will be analyzed using Deep Learning , aiming to detect QR codes from wallets and decoding them to obtain the wallet PublicKey.

## Project Description (II)

Once obtained the wallet, our backend will immediately whitelist this PublicKey on our Whitelisting Contract in Solana Blockchain.

This Whitelisting Contract is an on-chain program, designed to store wallets using PDAs.  Also, a counter will be integrated in another program to know the number of wallets stored.

Everything with Smart Contracts.

## Project Description (III)

Once the wallet is whitelisted, we will have the option to instantly send NFTs to this user, so he/she could be able to redeem these NFTs inside the event.
